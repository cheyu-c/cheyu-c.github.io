%%  Matlab Vector exercises
%  A.J. Melhus  4/4/10

% When performing mathematical operations in Matlab, the word "vector" 
% often comes up.  What exactly does "vector" mean to Matlab and why 
% use them?

% A vector is simply a list of numbers.  In terms of linear algebra, 
% vectos are 1 dimensional matrices - either a single-row or single-column 
% matrix.  Vectors are important to Matlab because they are almost always 
% the quickest and most efficient method for getting an answer.
    
% Matlab stands for "Matrix Laboratory," which means that Matlab is very 
% good at vector and matrix mathematics.

%% Defining vectors
%  There are 3 basic ways to define a vector in Matlab:

% 1. Manually enter every vector element, using 

x = [3, 5, 7, 9]
% (see below for what MATLAB makes of this command)

% This approach works for arrays of numbers too, with commas and/or 
% spaces to separate entries and semicolons to separate rows:

x = [0, 1, 2; 3, 4, 5]

% 2. Use colon notation.  This method allows you to quickly generate 
% series vectors with a pre-defined or user-specified element width.
    
% Syntax:
%     xstart:dx:xend 
        % xstart is the first value of your vector
        % dx (optional) is the step width, the difference between two 
        %    consecutive entries
        % xend is the last value of your vector

% A simple example showing that the default increment is 1
y1 = 1:5 

% there are more entries here because the step size, dy, is smaller
y2 = 1:0.5:5  
 
% 3. Use a built-in function to create vectors of specified size - zeros, 
% ones, linspace, logspace.  These functions are helpful because they let 
% you decide how many entries you want in the vector, and do the rest for 
%y ou.

% The most useful for basic plotting is linspace.
  %Syntax:
  % linspace(xstart, xend, num_entries)
  % num_entries is the number of entries (or size) in your vector
  
% Here a vector from 0 to 3.8, with 10 equally-spaced entries:
y3 = linspace(0,3.8, 10)   

% Initialize an array and fill with zeros
y4 = zeros(3)

 
 
%% Vector math
% When doing vector mathematics, it is useful to understand how MATLAB 
% performs operations with vectors.  The important distinction here is 
% the use of the dot, .  This tells MATLAB to perform mathematical 
% operations element-by-element, instead of normal linear algebra.  
% Another important notation is the apostrophe, '.  This tells Matlab 
% to transpose the vector - change it from a row vector to a column 
% vector or vice-versa.  It is easiest if you do the following simple 
% examples for yourself:
     
% Make a couple of example vectors
a = 1:5;
b = 6:10;
% The semicolon at the end keeps them from printing on the screen 
% with the name "ans," short for answer.  You can see the values just 
% by typing the variable name at the prompt, like:
a

% Now on to manipulations
% Addition (or subtraction) is automatically element-by-element
a + b

% Multiplication (and division) are trickier: they can go
% element-by-element or as vector operations.

% The dot before the multiplicaiton symbol makes the multiplication 
% (in this case, or any operation in general) work element-by-element.
 a.*b  
% Mulitplying without the dot here leaves MATLAB confused, because it's
% thinking how to multiply two vectors rather than element-by-element
%    a*b
% would give an error message. 

% If you know about vector dot products, MATLAB will happily produce those,
% but first the vector dimensions must agree.  To do that, make b into a
% column vector
b'
% Then a*b' works, and gives the dot product:
a*b'
% Since the dot product is commutative, a*b' = b*a', as
b*a'

% For any of these operations to work, the vectors must have the same
% lengths.  Define a new vector c, which has more entries than a or b:
    c = 0:5
% Now
%   a.*c 
% produces an error.

%% Vectors in functions
% When making functions and equations more complicated in nature, it is 
% important to keep these rules in mind, to ensure Matlab is doing what 
% you want it to.

% This works:
  x = 1:4
  (x+1)./x
% but 
   (x+1)/x
% without the dot will only work if x is a single number, but not a vector
% REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH you only get one number back (can you work out what it's done to get 
% the answer here?).

% Fortunately, MATLAB's built-in functions like sqrt() or sin() know this
% and will work on vectors:
sin(x)
