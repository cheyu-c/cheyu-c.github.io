         <h1>Contour maps</h1>
         <p>To display isolines of an image array, MATLAB has provided a handy function <b><tt>contour</tt></b>. Assuming <b><tt>PNE</tt></b> is our image array:

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="contourmap_01.png" alt=""> <p><i>Don't forget to add <b><tt>axis image</tt></b> to avoid distortion!</i></p>
         <p>Let's try make a contour image:</p><pre class="codeinput">contour(PNE)
axis <span class="string">image</span>
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="contourmap_02.png" alt=""> <p><i>Note that image created by <b><tt>imagesc</tt></b> is flipped up-side-down compared to the one created by <b><tt>contour</tt></b>!</i></p>
         <p>You may find out that this takes a long long time, maybe forever. Also, it looks messy! This is because when the values of
            the level curves and/or the number of contour lines are not specified by the user, <b><tt>contour</tt></b> will choose these values automatically. In our case, the emission from the object (the PNe) is not too much stronger than
            background (the sky); therefore even the weak fluctuations on the sky are shown in the contour map, which is not what we want.
         </p>
         <p>One way to improve this contour map is to specify how many contour levels will be shown in the map:</p><pre class="codeinput">contour(PNE, 5)

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="contourmap_03.png" alt=""> <p>Then the messy background went away. However, the structure in the PNe also disappeared, because there's not enough contour
            level.
         </p>
         <p>If we want to focus on the PNe itself, we might want to specify all values of the contour lines. First we'll need to know
            what's the range of the PNe emission; the easiest way to do so is to use <b><tt>colormap</tt></b>:

%% Contour maps
% To display isolines of an image array, MATLAB has provided a handy
% function *|contour|*. Assuming *|PNE|* is our image array:
imagesc(PNE)

% _Don't forget to add *|axis image|* to avoid distortion!_
%
% Let's try make a contour image:
contour(PNE)
axis image

% _Note that image created by *|imagesc|* is flipped up-side-down compared

% You may find out that this takes a long long time, maybe forever. Also,

% One way to improve this contour map is to specify how many contour levels
% will be shown in the map:
contour(PNE, 5)
axis image
%%
% Then the messy background went away. However, the structure in the PNe
% also disappeared, because there's not enough contour level.
