%% Cluster HR Diagrams
% In this script HR diagrams are plotted for two globular clusters with
% magnitudes obtained from the SDSS online tool SkyServer. See the ASTR 121
% lab Cluster HR Diagrams for a description of how to obtain the data at
% SkyServer.
%% Import Data
% The data file downloaded from SkyServer can be imported using
dat1 = importdata('cluster1.dat', ',', 1); % the ',' specifies the delimeter and the number 1 specifies the number of header lines
                                           % This is the Palomar 5 cluster
% Now view the header line to see the order of parameters (what each column
% in the data matrix is):

dat1.textdata;

% and create a matrix containing the data only

cluster1data = dat1.data;

% Now do the same for the second cluster:
dat2 = importdata('cluster2.dat', ',', 1); % Palomar 6 Cluster
cluster2data = dat2.data;

% Note that the g column is the 11th and the r column is the 12.

%% Plotting the HR diagrams
% In order to plot the HR diagrams for the clusters we first want to
% extract the relevant data for clarity. We want two arrays containing the
% read and blue magnitudes.

g1 = cluster1data(:,11);
r1 = cluster1data(:,12);
g2 = cluster2data(:,11);
r2 = cluster2data(:,12);

% Now we can plot the two HR diagrams simultaneously:
figure;

set(axes, 'YDir', 'reverse') % Because of the reverse nature of magnitudes (brighter object has lower value) we reverse the y axis
hold on;
plot(g1-r1, r1,'g.') % Plots the stellar magnitudes of the first cluster with green points
plot(g2-r2, r2,'r.') % plots the second cluster with red points
xlabel('g-r magnitude')
ylabel('r magnitude')
%% Interpreting HR diagrams

% Notice that the Palomar 3 SDSS field has very few stars. There is a
% semblance of the main-sequence turnoff point, but it is unclear. Sadly,
% there are only two clusters resolved in the SDSS field of view, as so
% these are the only two in the archive. Go to the Hipparcos data archive
% online for a more complete collection of magnitudes for stars in clusters
% (Hipparcos covered a larger area of the sky).

% Note that these clusters are not at the same distance. How does this
% affect the
