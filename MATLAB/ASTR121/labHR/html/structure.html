         <h2>What is a structure?<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>A structure is a MATLAB data type that provides the means to store selected data together in a single entity. A structure
            consists mainly of data containers, called fields, and each of these fields stores an array of some MATLAB data type. You
            assign a name to each field as you create the structure. The figure below shows a structure <b><tt>s</tt></b> that has three fields: <b><tt>a</tt></b>, <b><tt>b</tt></b>, and <b><tt>c</tt></b>.
         <img src="struct01.jpg" alt=""></p>
         <p>Each field of a structure contains a separate MATLAB array. This array can belong to any one MATLAB or user-defined class,
            and can have any valid array dimensions. A second field of the same structure can belong to an entirely different class, and
            can also have different dimensions than the first. The fields of the structure shown above, for example, contain a 1-by-6
            array of class <b><tt>double</tt></b>, a 1-by-5 array of class <b><tt>char</tt></b>, and a 3-by-3 array of <b><tt>double</tt></b>.
         </p>
         <h2>Reasons to use a structure<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>Perhaps the most common reason for using a structure (or a cell array) is the ability to store arrays of mixed classes and
            sizes. Most MATLAB arrays must contain the same number of elements which must also be of the same class. The role of the structure,
            and cell array, as containers of heterogeneous data is very important.
         </p>
         <p>A structure also provides the means to store selected data together in a single entity. This offers you the ability to access
            and operate on all or parts of the data collectively. You can apply functions directly to a structure, pass the structure
            to and from your M-file functions, display the value of any fields, or perform most any MATLAB operation on the contents of
            a structure.
         </p>
         <p>A third reason to use structures is that they give you the ability to apply text labels to your data, as opposed to using
            array subscripting.
         </p>
         <h2>Structure fields<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>To access the contents of a struct array, you first need to find out what the names of its fields are. Simply type the name
            of the structure (e.g., <b><tt>s</tt></b>) tells you the name of its fields, and what type of class these fields are:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">s
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
s = 

    a: [1 4 7 2 9 3]
    b: 'James'
    c: [3x3 double]

</pre><p>Then you can use the syntax <b><tt>s.a</tt></b> to read the information inside field <b><tt>a</tt></b> of the structure <b><tt>s</tt></b>:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">s.a
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     1     4     7     2     9     3

</pre><p>Note: it is possible that a field of a structure is a structure itself, like <b><tt>isoc</tt></b> you are going to load from file <b><tt>isochrones.mat</tt></b>.

%% What is a structure?
% A structure is a MATLAB data type that provides the means to store
% selected data together in a single entity. A structure consists mainly of
% data containers, called fields, and each of these fields stores an array
% of some MATLAB data type. You assign a name to each field as you create
% the structure. The figure below shows a structure *|s|* that has three
% fields: *|a|*, *|b|*, and *|c|*.
%
% Each field of a structure contains a separate MATLAB array. This array
% can belong to any one MATLAB or user-defined class, and can have any
% valid array dimensions. A second field of the same structure can belong
% to an entirely different class, and can also have different dimensions
% than the first. The fields of the structure shown above, for example,
% contain a 1-by-6 array of class *|double|*, a 1-by-5 array of class 
% *|char|*, and a 3-by-3 array of *|double|*.
%% Reasons to use a structure
% Perhaps the most common reason for using a structure (or a cell array) is
% the ability to store arrays of mixed classes and sizes. Most MATLAB
% arrays must contain the same number of elements which must also be of the
% same class. The role of the structure, and cell array, as containers of
% heterogeneous data is very important.
%
% A structure also provides the means to store selected data together in a
% single entity. This offers you the ability to access and operate on all
% or parts of the data collectively. You can apply functions directly to a
% structure, pass the structure to and from your M-file functions, display
% the value of any fields, or perform most any MATLAB operation on the
% contents of a structure.
%
% A third reason to use structures is that they give you the ability to
% apply text labels to your data, as opposed to using array subscripting.
%% Structure fields
% To access the contents of a struct array, you first need to find out what
% the names of its fields are. Simply type the name of the structure (e.g.,
% *|s|*) tells you the name of its fields, and what type of class these
% fields are:
s
%%
% Then you can use the syntax *|s.a|* to read the information inside field 
% *|a|* of the structure *|s|*:
s.a

% Note: it is possible that a field of a structure is a structure itself,
% like *|isoc|* you are going to load from file *|isochrones.mat|*.
