% This function file defines the Planck function to be used in the BB and
% HR diagram lab:

function f = planck(x);     % define the function
h = 6.626e-27 % erg s
c = 2.998e10 % cm /s



f = x.^2;                   % calculate f, the returned value, from x

% Note that the exponentiation is written as .^ (dot carat);
% this way it will operate on each element of an input vector x.
% Element-by-element multiplication would be .*, division ./, etc.
