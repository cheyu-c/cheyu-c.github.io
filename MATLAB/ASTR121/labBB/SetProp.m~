% Sometimes we would like to focus on part of our plots to investigate the
% structure. You can use *|xlim|* and *|ylim|* to set which part of the
% parameter space you want to plot. 
% 
% For example, the previous version of the Planck function:
loglog(nu, Intensity, 'b.')
%%
% If we want to focus on the part with maximum intensity:
ylim([1e-20 1e-3])
%%
% The syntax of *|xlim|* is similar: *|xlim([min max])|*.
%%  
% With a simple conversion of frequency to wavelength (in angstroms) we can
% replot our graph in an easier way to interpret in the context of optical
% observations (for temp = 0.3*T):
c = 2.998e10;
wavelength = c./nu / 1e-8;

% visible light band (~3900 - 7500 Angstroms):
