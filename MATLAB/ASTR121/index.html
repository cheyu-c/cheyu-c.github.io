ASTR121: Introduction to Astronomy (Spring)
<h2/>
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labIntro">Lab01: Introduction to Matlab</a></h3>
Introducing Matlab in a way as to prepare you for the labs throughout the semester.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labError">Lab02: Parallax and Introduction to Error Analysis</a></h3>
To understand and apply methods of data analysis.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labBinary">Lab03: Binary Stars and Stellar Masses</a></h3>
In this lab you will use spectra taken at 7 times for a binary star system for which one can identify the 
H-alpha absorption line and obtain from it a radial velocity measurement. You can then use measures of 
shifts in the absorption line wavelength in order to determine the total mass of the binary system.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labBB">Lab04: Blackbody and Stellar Spectra</a></h3>
The temperature of a star plays an important role in determining the characteristics of the light we 
observe from it.  In this lab, you will explore temperature's role in the stellar classification system 
and in the HR diagram.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labHR">Lab05: Cluster HR Diagrams</a></h3>
In this lab you use online data from SDSS in order to obtain data for two star clusters and 
plot their HR diagrams. By comparing the two you'll gain further understanding of cluster age 
and evolution. The clusters are the example clusters listed in the teaching section of SkyServer, an 
SDSS online tool. 
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labMW">Lab06: The Shape and Scale of The Milky Way</a></h3>
In this lab the student uses data from open and globular clusters in order to map the shape of the 
Milky Way.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labHI">Lab07: HI Rotation Curve of the Milky Way</a></h3>
In this lab, you will examine radio observations of neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way to determine the 
rotation curve of the Milky Way.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labHubble">Lab08: Hubble's Law</a></h3>
In this lab, you will analyze spectra of galaxies to determine their redshift, calculate their distance 
based on their apparent vs absolute magnitude, and use Hubble's Law to determine Hubble's constant.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labGal">Lab09: Galaxy Morphologies</a></h3>
This lab gives you practice at identifying and categorizing galaxies of varying morphology.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labSLM">Lab10: Superluminal Motion and Quasar Jets</a></h3>
In this lab an image of bright knots in a relativistic jet is provided and you are asked to measure the
superluminal motion and derive the gamma factor.
<h3><hr width="100%">
<a href="labLSS">Lab11: Large-Scale Structure</a></h3>
In this lab, you will analyze spectra of galaxies to determine their redshift, and you will then plot 
the positions of the galaxies to reveal the large scale structure of a portion of the universe.
