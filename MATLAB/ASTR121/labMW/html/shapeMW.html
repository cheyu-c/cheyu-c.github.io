##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Shape and Scale of the Milky Way
% Here the student plots the positions of star clusters and shows the
% relative distribution around the Milky Way galaxy of open clusters
% compared to globular clusters through projection onto the
% xy, xz, and yz planes where x is defined along the direction to the
% galactic center and z is height in direction of the galactic North pole.
%% Part I
% First, let us plot the survey of open clusters in equatorial coordinates,
% namely right ascension (in hours) and declination (in degrees) above or
% below the equatorial plane.

% Before we do that we have to load the data. While the data source with
% the full data is listed in the lab handout, the numerical values needed
% here have been compiled into a simplified table found in
% clusters_relevant.txt.

load clusters_relevant.txt
cr = clusters_relevant;

% In this table the first, second, and third columns contain the RA in
% hours, minutes, and seconds and these values must be combined into a
% single decimal value of hours:
RA = cr(:,1) + cr(:,2)/60 + cr(:,3)/3600;
% The same goes for the declination, though it is given by degrees, arcmin,
% and arcsec in the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns respectively:
dec = cr(:,4) + (cr(:,5)/60 + cr(:,6)/3600).*cr(:,4)./abs(cr(:,4));
% Note that the cr/abs(cr) term simply insures the sign carried by the
% fourth column value is carried over to the other two values added, as
% they will have matching sign.

% Now let's plot the open clusters in RA vs dec, i.e. equatorial
% coordinates.
figure(1); clf
plot(RA,dec,'.')
xlabel('RA (hrs)')
ylabel('dec (degrees)')

% We can also plot, with a red circle, the location of the galactic center
% in order to get a feel for how open clusters are distributed in the
% galactic plane. Since the equatorial plane is tilted with respect to the
% galactic plane, the clusters, which gather mostly in the galactic plane,
% follow a sinusoidal curve on this plot.

hold on
gal = [17 + 45/60. + 40.04/3600, -29 - 28.1/3600];
plot(gal(1),gal(2),'or')

%% Part II
% Now we plot the distribution of the same 1777 open clusters, but this
% time we have distance information about the clusters and can plot them in
% 3-space rather than just their projection onto the celestial sphere as we
% did in Part I.

% Load the data in a new, simplfiied, table, where this time the third
% column gives distance in pc and the coordinates are in galactic
% coordinates (longitude and latitude both in degrees).

load clusters_relevantGAL.txt
crgal = clusters_relevantGAL;

% We must change from degrees to radians since we will use cos and sin
% functions to transform from galactic (i.e. polar) to cartesian
% coordinates:
lon = crgal(:,1).*2*pi/360.0;
lat = crgal(:,2).*2*pi/360.0;

xoc = crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*cos(lon);
yoc = crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*sin(lon);
zoc = crgal(:,3).*sin(lat);

% Now let's plot the projection of the open clustes onto the x-y plane
% (distribution as viewed from above galaxy):
hold off
figure(2); clf
plot(xoc,yoc, '.')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('y (pc)')

% Also the projection onto the other two planes intersecting the galactic
% center, one perpendicular to the line of sight from earth and one
% parallel:
figure(3); clf
plot(xoc,zoc, '.')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')

figure(4); clf
plot(yoc,zoc, '.')
xlabel('y (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')

%% Part III
% Now we load an analagous table of data for globular clusters and plot
% them in the same plane projections as we did for the open clusters:

load mwgc_short_relevant.txt
crgal = mwgc_short_relevant;
lon = crgal(:,1).*2*pi/360.0;
lat = crgal(:,2).*2*pi/360.0;

xgc = 1000.*crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*cos(lon); % This time distance is tabulated in kpc, so we must multiply by 10^3 to convert.
ygc = 1000.*crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*sin(lon);
zgc = 1000.*crgal(:,3).*sin(lat);

% We plot the projections of the open clusters in blue and the globular clusters in red: 

hold off
figure(5); clf
plot(xoc,yoc, '.')
hold on
plot(xgc,ygc, '.r')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('y (pc)')

figure(6); clf
plot(xoc,zoc, '.')
hold on
plot(xgc,zgc, '.r')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')

figure(7); clf
plot(yoc,zoc, '.')
hold on
plot(ygc,zgc, '.r')
xlabel('y (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')

% It is clear that globular clusters are not bound to the plane of the
% galaxy and trace the dark matter potential well better than open
% clusters. This picture is also consistent with our knowledge that
% globular clusters are often much older than open clusters, which much
% more often form in star-forming regions in the dense planes of galaxies.
