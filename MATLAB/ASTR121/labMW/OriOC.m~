% Let us plot the survey of open clusters in equatorial coordinates, namely 
% right ascension (in hours) and declination (in degrees) above or below 
% the equatorial plane. Note that, while the data source with the full data 
% is listed in the lab handout, the numerical values needed here have been 
% compiled into a simplified table found in *|clusters_relevant.txt|*.
%
% First, we have to load the data:
load clusters_relevant.txt
%%
% and save the data to a matrix variable, e.g., *|cr|*:
cr = clusters_relevant;
%%
% In this table the first, second, and third columns contain the RA in
% hours, minutes, and seconds. These values must be combined into a single 
% decimal value of hours:
RA = cr(:,1) + cr(:,2)/60 + cr(:,3)/3600;
%%
% The same goes for the declination, though it is given by degrees, arcmin,
% and arcsec in the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns respectively:
dec = cr(:,4) + (cr(:,5)/60 + cr(:,6)/3600).*cr(:,4)./abs(cr(:,4));
%%
% Note that the *|cr/abs(cr)|* term simply insures the sign carried by the
% fourth column value is carried over to the other two values added, as
% they will have matching sign.
%
% Now let's plot the open clusters in RA vs dec, i.e. equatorial
% coordinates.
