% Now we plot the distribution of the same 1777 open clusters, but this 
% time we have distance information about the clusters and can plot them in 
% 3-space rather than just their projection onto the celestial sphere as we 
% did in Part I.
%
% First, load the data and save in 
load clusters_relevantGAL.txt
crgal = clusters_relevantGAL;

% Load the data in a new, simplfiied, table, where this time the third
% column gives distance in pc and the coordinates are in galactic
% coordinates (longitude and latitude both in degrees).


% We must change from degrees to radians since we will use cos and sin
% functions to transform from galactic (i.e. polar) to cartesian
% coordinates:
lon = crgal(:,1).*2*pi/360.0;
lat = crgal(:,2).*2*pi/360.0;

xoc = crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*cos(lon);
yoc = crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*sin(lon);
zoc = crgal(:,3).*sin(lat);

% Now let's plot the projection of the open clustes onto the x-y plane
% (distribution as viewed from above galaxy):
hold off
figure(2); clf
plot(xoc,yoc, '.')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('y (pc)')

% Also the projection onto the other two planes intersecting the galactic
% center, one perpendicular to the line of sight from earth and one
% parallel:
figure(3); clf
plot(xoc,zoc, '.')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')

figure(4); clf
plot(yoc,zoc, '.')
xlabel('y (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')
