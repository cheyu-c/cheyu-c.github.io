%% Read and organize the data
% Now we load an analagous table of data for globular clusters and plot 
% them in the same plane projections as we did for the open clusters:
load mwgc_short_relevant.txt
galGC = mwgc_short_relevant;
%%
% Change from degrees to radians:
lon = gal(:,1).*2*pi/360.0;
lat = gal(:,2).*2*pi/360.0;
%%
% This time distance is tabulated in kpc, so we must multiply by $10^3$ to 
% convert from polar (galactic) to cartesian coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$):
xgc = 1000.*crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*cos(lon); 
ygc = 1000.*crgal(:,3).*cos(lat).*sin(lon);
zgc = 1000.*crgal(:,3).*sin(lat);
%% Make the plots
% Let's plot the projections of the open clusters in blue, and the globular 
% clusters in red:
figure(5); clf
plot(xoc,yoc, 'b.')
hold on
plot(xgc,ygc, 'r.')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('y (pc)')
%%
figure(6); clf
plot(xoc,zoc, 'b.')
hold on
plot(xgc,zgc, 'r.')
xlabel('x (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')
%%
figure(7); clf
plot(yoc,zoc, 'b.')
hold on
plot(ygc,zgc, 'r.')
xlabel('y (pc)')
ylabel('z (pc)')
%%
% It is clear that globular clusters are not bound to the plane of the
% galaxy and trace the dark matter potential well better than open
% clusters. This picture is also consistent with our knowledge that
% globular clusters are often much older than open clusters, which much
% more often form in star-forming regions in the dense planes of galaxies.
