%% Superluminal Motion and Quasar Jets
% In the Superluminal Motion lab the student explores what is meant by
% "superluminal motion" and in doing so gains experience plotting functions and writing function files and matlab scripts.
%% First the student learns to write a script and a function in .m files

% Open functionExample.m and read what each part does. Let's try plotting
% the function defined in this file using plotExample.m 

plotExample

% Note where in plotExample functionExample is called.

% From here on the student is expected to make changes to plotExample,
% renaming  this file to something personlized for this lab. However, for
% simplicity, I will include what would be added to plotExample here.

beta = .99;
theta = linspace(0, pi, 200);   % independent variable vector
bT = betaT(beta,theta);                       % dependent variable

hold off;
figure(2);clf                         % clear the figure area, just in case
plot(theta, bT, 'b')             % plot y vs. x, with blue line
xlabel('theta (angle to line of sight)')        % x label
ylabel('transverse velocity (normalized to c)')        % y label
title('Plot of Transverse Velocity')   % title for plot
ylim([0 20]) % set the limits of the vertical axis so you can see structure of the equations for beta~1



% Let's add a few other curves for varying value of beta:
hold on
beta = [0.5,0.7,0.9, 0.995, 0.999, 0.9999];
for i=1:6,
    bT = betaT(beta(i),theta);
    plot(theta, bT, 'b')
end

%% Measuring SLM using a quasar jet image at different epochs in time

% First we find the distance to 3C 279.

H0 = 74.2; % km / s / Mpc  the Hubble constant
z = 0.5362; % redshift of 3C 279
c = 3e8; % m/s
pc2m = 3.086e16; % conversion from pc to meters

v = z*c;
D = v/1000 /H0; % divide by 1000 to get v in units of km/s, D in Mpc

as2pc = 2*pi/360/60/60 * D * 1e6; % conversion factor between 1 arcsec on sky and distance at source (in pc)

% I estimate the brightest knot moved from about 2 milliarcsec away from the
% central source to about 2.5 milliarcsec in 2.7 years.

yr2s = 31556926; % one year in seconds
v = .5e-3 * as2pc * pc2m / yr2s % velocity observed in m/s. 

% This velocity is much greater than the speed of light! But, we know this
% is not true velocity. If we assume an inclination angle of the jet along
% which the knot moves to the line of sight which maximizes transverse
% velocity, then we get a lower limit on the actual velocity of the knot in
% the rest frame of the Quasar.
