%% Measuring SLM using a quasar jet image at different epochs in time
% Though I include step-by-step instructions here, the results are not
% shown. Try these commands by yourself and find out your own result.
%% Find the distance to 3C 279
% Set up the constant parameters first:
%
% The Hubble constant, in units of *km/s/Mpc*
H0 = 74.2;
%%
% the redshift of 3C 279 (redshift has no unit!)
z = 0.5362;
%%
% the speed of light, in units of *m/s*
c = 3e8;
%%
% The conversion factor from *pc* to *meters*: 1pc = 3.086e16 m
pc2m = 3.086e16;
%%
% The receding velocity can be calculated from the redshift:
v = z*c;
%%
% This is in units of *m/s*. To calculate the distance using the Hubble constant,
% we need to divide *|v|* by 1000 to get v in units of *km/s*. Then we can
% get D in *Mpc*:
D = (v/1000) /H0
%% The scale between angle on the sky and the distance
% _If you are not familiar with *angular diameter*, check the wiki page:_
%
% The real "ruler" on the sky at distance *|D|* is the angle we observed
% times the distance *|D|*, while the angle is measured in *rad*. The
% conversion factor from *deg* to *rad* is
deg2rad = (2*pi)/360;
%%
% Therefore, 1 *arcsec* = 1 *deg* / (60*60) is (in units of *rad*)
asc = deg2rad / (60*60);
%%
% Therefore the conversion factor between 1 *arcsec* on sky and distance at 
% 3C 279 (in *pc*) is (recall that our *|D|* is in units of *Mpc* = 1e6
% *pc*)
as2pc = asc * (D*1e6)
%% Transverse velocity of the knot
% Using the image, I estimate the brightest knot moved from about *2 
% milliarcsec* away from the central source to about *2.5 milliarcsec* in 
% *2.7 years*. The velocity in the sky is thus
vSky = (2.5 - 2)/2.7;
%%
% This is in units of *milliarcsec / years*, which is not very useful. We
% want to convert it to our familiar unit system *m/s*.
%
% First, convert *milliarcsec* to the real ruler on the sky, *pc*:
vpc = (vSky*1e-3)*as2pc;
%%
% Then convert *pc* to *meter*:
vm = vpc*pc2m;
%%
% But we still need to convert the time unit from *year* to *second*:
yr2s = 31556926;
%%
% Therefore the velocity observed in *m/s* is
v = vm / yr2s
%%
% This velocity is much greater than the speed of light! 
%% The true velocity
% But, we know this is not true velocity. If we assume an inclination angle 
% of the jet along which the knot moves to the line of sight which 
% maximizes transverse velocity, then we get a lower limit on the actual 
% velocity of the knot in the rest frame of the Quasar.
%
% Recall that
%
% $$\beta_T^\mathrm{MAX} = \beta \gamma$$
%
% and
%
% $$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$$
%
% where
%
% $$ \beta = \frac{v_\mathrm{true}}{c}$$
%
% is the real movement of the knot. If we assume the transverse velocity
% *|v|* we derived satisfied
%
% $$ \frac{v}{c} = \beta_T^\mathrm{MAX} 
% 
beta = sqrt(1-1/(v/c)^2) % approximate beta_T^max = beta*gamma as gamma since beta ~1 in the numerator.

% Bottom line; material emitting brightly as the knot is moving
% relativistically.
