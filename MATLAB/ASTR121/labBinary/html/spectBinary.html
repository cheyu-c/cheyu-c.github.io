         <!--introduction-->
         <p>In this lab the student uses spectra taken at 7 times for a binary star system for which one can identify the Halpha absorption
            line and obtain from it a radial velocity measurement. The student then uses measures of shifts in the absorption line wavelength
            in order to determine the total mass of the binary system.

%% Binary Stars and Stellar Masses
% In this lab the student uses spectra taken at 7 times for a binary star
% system for which one can identify the Halpha absorption line and obtain
% from it a radial velocity measurement. The student then uses measures of
% shifts in the absorption line wavelength in order to determine the total
% mass of the binary system.
%% Loading data

% First we must load the 7 spectra from this spectroscopic binary containing
% the absorption lines which we will use to determine orbital period.

load('binary1.dat')
load('binary2.dat')
load('binary3.dat')
load('binary4.dat')
load('binary5.dat')
load('binary6.dat')
load('binary7.dat')

% Now there are seven matricies, binary1, etc, containing two columns: the
% first gives the wavelength in angstroms for the spectrum and the second
% gives a normalized flux.

% Let's plot one of these spectra:
figure(1); clf
plot(binary1(:,1), binary1(:,2),'.')
xlabel('wavelength (angstroms)')
ylabel('normalized flux')
title('HIalpha absorption spectrum in a binary system (epoch 1)')

% The primary feature of this spectrum is the HIalpha absorption line. Note
% that it is doubled, as this spectrum is the combined spectrum of both
% stars. Since it is not clear that it is doubled in this spectrum, let's
% look at the next:

hold off
figure(2); clf
plot(binary2(:,1), binary2(:,2),'.')
xlabel('wavelength (angstroms)')
ylabel('normalized flux')
title('HIalpha absorption spectrum in a binary system (epochs 2-7)')

% The separation of the two features, relativistically shifted with respect
% to one another, is now much more evident.

%% Measurements

% Consider our first plot. In this case the absorption lines are nearly
% coincident in wavelength, suggesting that at this point in time the stars
% were moving nearly perpendicular to our line of sight, and the wavelength
% of the absorption line should be it's rest-frame wavelength. 

% We can use 
[c,i] = min(binary1(200:400,2)) 
% to find the position of the minimum (lowest point in absorption line
% profile). The value of c is that of the wavelength at the minimum, and i
% is the array index of this value in binary1(10:505) (note it is NOT the
% array index for the value in binary1, rather the sub-set we chose in
% order to avoid unrealistic minima at the edge). The '2' identifies the
% dimension in our matrix we're feeding min() along which to find the
% minimum.

rest = c;

% Now go to the second plot. select the 'data cursor' tab and click on the
% data point at each minima of the profiles, and record these values. In
% fact, plot all the data and record all the position in wavelength of the
% minima:
hold off
figure(3)
plot(binary3(200:400,1), binary3(200:400,2),'.')
figure(4)
plot(binary4(200:400,1), binary4(200:400,2),'.')
figure(5)
plot(binary5(200:400,1), binary5(200:400,2),'.')
figure(6)
plot(binary6(200:400,1), binary6(200:400,2),'.')
figure(7)
plot(binary7(200:400,1), binary7(200:400,2),'.')

% putting these values into arrays (relative strength of features signifies
% which star is which):
bin1lambda = [6571,6573,6570,6571,6573,6572,6569] %weaker absorption feature
bin2lambda = [6572,6569,6572,6571,6568,6569,6573] %stronger

% And now we can plot these:
t = [78.831,79.581,80.742,81.943,82.670,82.982,83.960] % tracking of Julian date (subtracted off constant of time):

hold off;
figure(8);
plot(t,bin1lambda,'.r')
hold on
plot(t,bin2lambda,'.b')
ylabel('wavelength (angstroms)')
xlabel('time (days, with arbitrary reference point)')

% Conveniently there appears to  be another time at which the stars are
% moving perpendicular to the line of sight at t(4). So we can estimate the
% period to be an integer (or 1/integer) multiple of this time. If we guess
% that it's one half of a complete period:
tforsin = linspace(t(1),t(7),300);
% I overplot a function to fit to the red dots of the form
% A sin((t-t_phase)*2pi / P) where t_phase is a time phase shift and P is
% the period of the binary orbit.
yr = bin1lambda(1)+(bin1lambda(2)-bin1lambda(1))*sin((tforsin-t(1)) * 2*pi/(t(4)-t(1)));
plot(tforsin,yr,'g')

% This fits, by eye, the data rather well. So, 
P = (t(4)-t(1))/365 % period in years

% Now, maximum LOS velocity together with the orbital period gives limit on orbital
% radius and then P and radius gives total mass. First we find the
% velocity:

v = 3e8 * (bin1lambda(2)-bin1lambda(1)) / bin1lambda(1) % in m/s

% Assuming a circular orbit we can get the minimum radius:
m2au = 6.68e-12; % meter in au units
s2yr = 3.17e-8; % second in yr units
r = v*(m2au/s2yr)*P / 2 / pi; % radius in au
a = 2*r % semimajor axis, if we assume a circular orbit and nearly equal masses.

% The fact that the velocity shifts of the lines are greater for one star
% than the other would imply unequal masses, but we do not have enough data
% to determine the mass ratio accurately.

M = 4*pi^2 * a^3 / P^2 % gives total mass of the two stars in solar masses (G=1 in these units).

% Rather massive stars, but not unreasonably large! We've found the mass of
% the system!
