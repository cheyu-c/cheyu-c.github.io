%%  Where to get HELP when using Matlab (REVISED)
%  A.J. Melhus, 4-18-10

%  4 Places to get help using Matlab:

%%  IN  MATLAB

% 1.  Use the <help> command.  
%This brings up a basic list of features about the function or script 
you are interested in, in the command window:
  
help cosh    % brings up a list of features of the cosh function
    
% 2.  Use the HELP window.  
%  Click on the characteristic blue box to bring up Matlabs help and demo window.  
%  - search for terms
%  - generally produces more results than <help> command line
%  - most sections have demos (view syntax and setup for problems)
  
    
%%  OUTSIDE  MATLAB

% 3. Use the internet.  
% - be more wary of this method
% - sometimes best tool for quick, bare-bones info
% - Google any Matlab-related question - someone probably has webpage about it


%%  ACTUAL PERSON

% 4. If you are on the Univ. of MD campus:
% - Matlab tutors in Regents Drive Garage (PG-2) WAM lab  
% - tutors are pros and can help with most Matlab problems, if you know how to ask
